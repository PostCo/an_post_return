      "reasoning": "This task involves standard Ruby gem setup with a moderate directory structure. While not highly complex, it requires careful organization of files and proper gemspec configuration. Breaking it into subtasks for initialization, directory creation, file setup, gemspec configuration, and module initialization would make it more manageable."

      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it integrates multiple components (SFTP client and parser) and implements incremental file processing logic. Six subtasks would cover class structure, SFTP integration, file ordering logic, incremental processing, data aggregation, and error handling."
